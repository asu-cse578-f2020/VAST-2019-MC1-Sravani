Backend needs to be running to use apis. Follow instructions from readme file in root folder. Once that is started, apis can be used.

For starting Frontend:
    i) Open one terminal in the root project directory VAST-2019-MC1-Sravani and change directory to the Frontend from the root directory  i.e., VAST-2019-MC1-Sravani using the following command:
        cd Frontend
    ii) Now start the python local server using the command
        python3 -m http.server
        (or)
        py -3 -m http.server
        (or)
        python -m http.server
        depending on your configuration.
    iii) Now, we should see a message "Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ..." which indicates the successful start of the python server and the Frontend.
